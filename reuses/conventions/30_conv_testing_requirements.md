# Convention: Testing Requirements

> Version: V00.04.00

## Rule

Requirements documents MUST include a `### Test` chapter and implementation MUST follow TDD with test code in the repository.

### Format

Every requirement section MUST include a test subsection:

```markdown
### Test
- [ ] **TEST-<ID>** Description of test coverage
- [ ] **TEST-<ID>** Reference the core requirement id you test with e.g. **FR-MA-CORE-01**
```

### Implementation Location

Tests MUST be implemented in: `src/tests/<testtype>/<feature>.test.ts`

Examples:
- `src/tests/unit/base-agent.test.ts`
- `src/tests/integration/agent-communication.test.ts`
- `src/tests/simulation/multi-agent-sim.test.ts`

### TDD Workflow

1. Write test FIRST (Red)
2. Implement code to pass test (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green (Refactor)

### Test Types

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Simulation tests**: Test multi-agent scenarios without consuming tokens

### Test Harness Reference

Requirements documents may reference test harness files for testing infrastructure:
- `reuses/proj_mychat/v1/requi/harness/010_file_harness.md`

### Constraints

- Tests MUST reference the requirement ID being tested (e.g. **FR-MA-CORE-01**)
- Tests MUST be runnable via `npm test` or equivalent
- Test files MUST be committed to the repository
- All edge cases MUST be covered (e.g. null inputs, invalid paths, error states)
- At least one integration test MUST be implemented in sim mode
- On user request via argument `syst`, a system test (e.g. for interaction without sim) MUST be executed

## Example

```markdown
### Testing
- [ ] **FR-TEST-01** Sim mode for testing without consuming tokens
- [ ] **FR-TEST-02** Dummy responses based on system prompt and requirements
- [ ] **FR-TEST-03** In your tests reference the core requirement id you test with e.g. **FR-MA-CORE-01**
- [ ] **FR-TEST-04** Crosscheck if 99% of requi in folder v1/requi are covered.
```

## Rationale

- Ensures all requirements are verifiable
- Prevents implementation drift
- Provides living documentation
- Enables automated requirement coverage analysis
